# Accumulator Detector Setup for Redmi 9 on Parrot Linux

## Prerequisites
1. **ADB Installation**: Ensure ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is installed on your Parrot Linux system. Use the following command to install:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-tools-adb -y
  ```
2.# Enable USB Debugging on Redmi 9

1. Go to **Settings > About Phone**.
2. Tap **MIUI Version** 7 times to enable Developer Options.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Additional Settings > Developer Options**.
4. Enable **USB Debugging**.
5. Connect your device via USB cable.



## Detect and Connect Android Device

### Step 1: Verify Device Connection
Run the following command to verify if your device is connected:

```bash
adb devices
```
If the device is connected, you'll see its serial number listed.
If t shows unauthorized, confirm the debugging prompt on the phone.
### Step 2: Access Battery Information
Once connected, you can retrieve the accumulator (battery) details:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys battery
```
Output Example:
```plaintext
Current Battery Service state:
  AC powered: false
  USB powered: true
  Wireless powered: false
  Max charging current: 1500000
  Max charging voltage: 5000000
  Charge counter: 123456
  status: 2
  health: 2
  present: true
  level: 87
  scale: 100
  voltage: 4100
  temperature: 290
  technology: Li-ion
level: Current battery percentage.
temperature: Battery temperature in tenths of a degree Celsius.
voltage: Current battery voltage in mV.
```
### Step 3: Monitor Real-Time Battery Status
You can use a loop to monitor battery status in real time:

```bash
while true; do adb shell dumpsys battery | grep -E "level|voltage|temperature"; sleep 5; done
```
**Troubleshooting**
### 1.ADB Not Detecting Device:

Restart the adb server:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
```
Ensure USB debugging is enabled on the device.
### 2.Permission Issues:

Add your user to the plugdev group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
```
Log out and back in to apply the changes.
## Notes
You can also explore GUI-based tools like GSConnect or KDE Connect for easier monitoring.
For advanced control, consider using tools like AccuBattery (on the device) or scripting custom automation via ADB.
Happy hacking!
